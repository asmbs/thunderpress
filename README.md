# [ThunderPress](https://github.com/asmbs/thunderpress)

ThunderPress is a WordPress stack, based on [Bedrock][bedrock]; it includes a few nice plugins and replaces Capistrano with [Mina][mina]. In addition, it allows you to control the source of specified plugins and themes as part of your core package â€” for those projects where purpose-built plugins and themes are used, but you don't want to manage separate repositories for each.
