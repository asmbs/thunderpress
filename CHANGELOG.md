# Changelog

## 2.1.0
- Built an improved salt generator that:
    - _Replaces_ salt keys if they already exist in the file, instead of always appending them.
    - If keys _are_ being appended to the end of the file, ensures there is a newline so the new key doesn't get tacked onto the end of the last one in the file.
- Renamed the Dotenv _distributed_ file to `.env.dist`.
